🔧 Instruction for Manus (copy-paste this)

Project Name: Curtis Software Studio Website (JSP + Bootstrap)

You are the lead developer.
Please create a complete, production-ready JSP-based website for Curtis Software Studio, a one-developer web development studio based in Coquitlam, BC.

1. Tech Stack & Architecture

Use JSP for all pages (e.g., index.jsp, about.jsp, etc.), suitable for deployment on Tomcat.

Use HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript.

Use Bootstrap 5 as the main CSS framework with a custom, modern design (no Tailwind).

Create shared layout components:

header.jsp (logo, navigation, language toggle)

footer.jsp (footer content, copyright, links)

All pages must be fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile) and visually polished.

2. Design Requirements

The site should look like a modern, professional studio website:

Clean layout, good use of whitespace and hierarchy.

Use a simple, consistent color palette (e.g. white + dark gray + one accent color).

Use Bootstrap’s grid system and components, but customize with additional CSS to avoid “default Bootstrap” look.

Use a consistent typography system (e.g. bold headings, clear body text).

Sticky top navigation on desktop.

Smooth scroll or basic transitions are a plus.

3. Bilingual Language Toggle (English / Traditional Chinese)

The site must support English and Traditional Chinese, but only one language is visible at a time.

Implementation guidelines:

Add a language toggle (e.g. buttons or dropdown) in the header:

EN and 繁中

Implement the language switch on the frontend using JavaScript:

Use CSS classes like .lang-en and .lang-zh on all text elements.

When language is set to English, show .lang-en and hide .lang-zh.

When language is set to Chinese, show .lang-zh and hide .lang-en.

Store the selected language in localStorage so that the preference persists across pages.

Default language can be English (EN).

Every heading, paragraph, button label, and navigation item must have both English and Traditional Chinese versions in the HTML, but only the selected language is visible.

Example pattern (for you to generalize):

<h1 class="lang-en">Custom websites & web applications for real businesses.</h1>
<h1 class="lang-zh">為真實商家打造的客製化網站與網頁系統。</h1>


JavaScript then controls visibility.

4. Logo

Create a simple, text-based logo in the header:

Brand name: Curtis Software Studio

Design:

Use typography and spacing to make it look like a wordmark.

You may emphasize “Curtis” or use a subtle styling like Curtis • Software • Studio.

Implement logo in header.jsp using HTML + CSS (no image file required, but you may add a small SVG or icon if helpful).

5. Pages to Implement

Create the following JSP pages, all using the shared header and footer, and all fully bilingual (via toggle).

5.1 index.jsp (Home)

Hero Section

At least 3 project case study templates (placeholder content).

5.5 faq.jsp (FAQ)

Create a FAQ page with at least 8–10 common questions and answers, in both languages via toggle.

Example topics:

Project Type (checkboxes: New Website, Redesign, Web Application, System Upgrade, Maintenance, Other)

The form does not need to submit to a real backend; you can:

Either simulate submission and redirect to thankyou.jsp, or

Prepare a form action placeholder and still redirect to thankyou.jsp after a fake submit.

All labels and help texts in both languages (controlled by the language toggle).

5.7 thankyou.jsp

6. SEO & Sitemap
6.1 Meta Tags

For each main page (index.jsp, about.jsp, services.jsp, portfolio.jsp, faq.jsp, contact.jsp, quote.jsp):

Add a meaningful <title> tag.

Add a <meta name="description" content="..."> summarizing the page in 1–2 sentences (English is fine, but you can include key terms like “Curtis Software Studio”, “Coquitlam, BC”, “web development”, “網站開發”, etc.).

Add basic Open Graph tags on index.jsp at least:

og:title

og:description

og:type

(Optionally og:url and og:image as placeholders)

6.2 sitemap.xml

Create a standard sitemap.xml file at the project root including URLs for:

/index.jsp

/about.jsp

/services.jsp

/portfolio.jsp

/faq.jsp

/contact.jsp

/quote.jsp

/thankyou.jsp

Use the correct XML sitemap structure.

7. Project Structure

Use a structure similar to:

/project-root
   /WEB-INF
      web.xml        # basic config if needed
   /includes
      header.jsp
      footer.jsp
   /css
      styles.css     # custom styles
   /js
      main.js        # language toggle, any interactivity

   index.jsp
   about.jsp
   services.jsp
   portfolio.jsp
   faq.jsp
   contact.jsp
   thankyou.jsp
   quote.jsp
   sitemap.xml


header.jsp and footer.jsp should be included in all pages via JSP includes.

8. Implementation Order

Please proceed in this order:

Implement the language toggle system (classes + JS + localStorage).

Fully implement index.jsp (Home) with all sections and bilingual content.

Implement about.jsp, services.jsp, portfolio.jsp, faq.jsp, contact.jsp, thankyou.jsp, and quote.jsp.

Add SEO meta tags to each page and generate sitemap.xml.

Ensure the entire site is responsive and visually polished.
